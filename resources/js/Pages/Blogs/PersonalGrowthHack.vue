    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">What if the secret to leveling up your life isn’t a big, drastic change, but a series of small, intentional steps you can start today? Personal growth doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. It’s about making small, consistent improvements that add up over time.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">In this post, I’m going to share 10 simple yet powerful growth hacks that you can begin implementing right now—no fluff, no complex theories, just real, actionable steps that will help you get closer to your best self.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 1: Set Clear, Achievable Goals -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 mb-4">1. Set Clear, Achievable Goals — Your Roadmap to Success</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">A dream without a plan is just a wish. But with a clear goal, you’ve got a roadmap to the future you want. You don’t have to have everything figured out, but a clear direction will guide you forward.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Start by breaking down your big dreams into small, actionable goals. Whether it’s fitness, career, or personal development, break it down into 30-day chunks and focus on the first 3 steps you can take right now.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Write down your number one goal for the next 30 days, then break it down into 3 daily tasks. Keep it simple, and start today.</p>

    <!-- Step 2: Embrace the Growth Mindset -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 mb-4">2. Embrace the Growth Mindset — Your Superpower for Success</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Your mindset is the lens through which you see the world. If you see obstacles as insurmountable, your growth will be limited. But if you see challenges as opportunities to learn, you’re unstoppable.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Start by catching your negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. For example, instead of saying, "I can’t do this," ask yourself, "How can I learn to do this?" It’s a simple shift that can have a massive impact.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">The next time you think, "I can’t," replace it with "How can I?" Make this a daily habit and watch your mindset transform.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 mb-4">3. Build Small, Daily Habits — The Compound Effect in Action</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">You don’t need to make huge changes to start seeing results. Small habits, repeated every day, add up to massive transformation over time. It’s the little things that make the biggest difference.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Pick one small habit to implement today—whether it’s drinking more water, stretching for 5 minutes, or writing in a journal. Make it so easy that you can’t say no.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Choose one small habit and do it every day for the next 30 days. Keep track of your streak, and celebrate each day you complete it!</p>
