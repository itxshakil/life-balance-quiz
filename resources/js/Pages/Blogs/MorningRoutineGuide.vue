    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">How you start your morning can set the tone for the rest of your day. A productive, focused, and energized morning routine can help you tackle anything that comes your way. But let’s be honest: building a routine that sticks isn’t as easy as it sounds. It requires consistency, planning, and a little self-discipline.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">In this post, we’ll walk through 6 simple, actionable steps that will help you create a morning routine that sets you up for success. Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl trying to make a change, these tips will work for you!</p>

    <!-- Step 1: Wake Up Early—Start Your Day with a Head Start -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 dark:text-orange-400 mb-4">Step 1: Wake Up Early—Start Your Day with a Head Start</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">You’ve heard it a million times: the early bird catches the worm. But there’s truth to it. Waking up just 30 minutes earlier than usual gives you the time to ease into your day and mentally prepare for the tasks ahead.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When you wake up early, you give yourself space to start the day on your terms, without feeling rushed or stressed.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Set your alarm 30 minutes earlier tomorrow. Use that time to slowly wake up, stretch, and prepare mentally for the day. Don’t jump straight into work or social media—let yourself enjoy the peace of the morning.</p>

    <!-- Step 2: Hydrate First—Replenish Your Body After Sleep -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 dark:text-orange-400 mb-4">Step 2: Hydrate First—Replenish Your Body After Sleep</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Your body has been fasting all night, so it’s important to rehydrate first thing in the morning. A glass of water can help jumpstart your metabolism, improve your skin, and boost your energy levels.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Starting your morning with hydration also sets the tone for a healthy and mindful day.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Before you reach for your phone or coffee, drink a glass of water. You can even add lemon or cucumber for an extra health boost. Try to make it a habit every morning!</p>

    <!-- Step 3: Move Your Body—Get the Blood Flowing -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 dark:text-orange-400 mb-4">Step 3: Move Your Body—Get the Blood Flowing</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Exercise isn’t just about staying in shape; it’s about waking up your body and mind. Whether it’s a quick stretch, yoga, or a full workout, moving your body in the morning helps you feel more alert, energized, and focused for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Physical activity also boosts endorphins, which can elevate your mood and mental clarity.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Start with a short 10-15 minute morning workout. Whether it’s stretching, a brisk walk, or a mini yoga session, get your body moving to kickstart your energy levels.</p>

    <!-- Step 4: Eat a Healthy Breakfast—Fuel Your Body for Success -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 dark:text-orange-400 mb-4">Step 4: Eat a Healthy Breakfast—Fuel Your Body for Success</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. A balanced breakfast that includes protein, healthy fats, and fiber will keep you full and energized throughout the morning. It also helps balance your blood sugar levels and keeps your mind sharp.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Start your day with foods that fuel your body and brain, not sugary cereals or empty calories.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Opt for a breakfast with protein and fiber, like oatmeal with nuts and fruit, or scrambled eggs with spinach and avocado. It doesn’t have to be fancy—just fuel your body with the nutrients it needs to perform at its best.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 dark:text-orange-400 mb-4">Step 5: Plan Your Day—Set Intentions for Success</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Now that your body is awake and energized, it’s time to set the tone for your day. Take a few minutes to plan your tasks, set your priorities, and decide on your top 3 goals for the day. When you know what you want to accomplish, you’ll be more focused and less likely to get distracted.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Planning your day also helps you stay calm, organized, and in control, even when life throws unexpected challenges your way.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Take 5-10 minutes every morning to review your schedule, write down your top 3 priorities, and set your intentions for the day. This simple habit can give you more clarity and focus throughout the day.</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Gratitude has the power to shift your mindset and bring more positivity into your life. When you start your day with a grateful heart, you set the tone for a day filled with appreciation and joy.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Taking a moment to express gratitude for the things you have, big or small, can transform your outlook and boost your mood.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">As soon as you wake up, take a few seconds to think of three things you’re grateful for. Write them down in a gratitude journal or simply reflect on them in your mind.</p>
