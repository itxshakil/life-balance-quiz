    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">We all want to feel like we’re living a life that matters. But somewhere along the way, the noise of everyday life can drown out what truly brings us fulfillment. Maybe you’ve felt lost, uncertain, or disconnected from your deeper purpose. You’re not alone, and more importantly, you can change it.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Finding your purpose doesn’t have to be a complicated or mystical journey. It’s about understanding what matters most to you and aligning your life with your core values. In this post, we’re going to walk through 6 practical steps to help you rediscover your purpose and make it the foundation of your life.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 1: Reflect on What Truly Matters to You -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400 mb-4">Step 1: Reflect on What Truly Matters to You—Dig Deep</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When was the last time you paused and asked yourself, "What really matters to me?" Life gets busy, and it’s easy to lose sight of the things that truly bring you joy and fulfillment. But before you can align your life with your purpose, you need to know what that purpose is.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Take a moment to reflect. Ask yourself what brings you the most satisfaction—what makes you feel alive, energized, and fulfilled? These are the things that are aligned with your core values. Write them down and hold onto them tightly.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Spend 10 minutes journaling about the things in life that make you feel the most fulfilled. Look for patterns or themes that connect them, and use these insights as a foundation for the next steps.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 2: Identify Your Core Values -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400 mb-4">Step 2: Identify Your Core Values—The Heart of Your Purpose</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Core values are the principles that guide your decisions, actions, and behaviors. They’re the internal compass that helps you navigate through life. When you’re clear on your core values, you can make choices that align with your true self.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Take some time to identify your top 3-5 core values. These could be things like honesty, compassion, creativity, growth, or adventure. Once you identify them, you’ll have a clearer sense of what your purpose looks like in practice.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Use a list of common values (like integrity, kindness, success, etc.) and narrow it down to your top 3-5. Reflect on how these values show up in your life, and ask yourself how you can live more in alignment with them moving forward.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 3: Align Your Actions with Your Values -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400 mb-4">Step 3: Align Your Actions with Your Values—Live Your Truth</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">It’s one thing to know your core values, but it’s another to live them every day. True fulfillment comes when your actions match your beliefs. If you say that family is important to you but you never spend time with them, you’re not living in alignment with that value.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">The key to finding your purpose is making sure that your day-to-day actions reflect what you believe is important. Start by looking at your current routines and commitments—are they serving your core values?</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Look at your calendar or to-do list. Are you making time for activities and relationships that align with your core values? If not, make small changes to prioritize them. If adventure is important to you, plan an activity that excites you.</p>

    <!-- Step 4: Embrace Change and Growth -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400 mb-4">Step 4: Embrace Change and Growth—Let Go of the Old to Make Space for the New</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Finding your purpose often means stepping into new territory—whether it’s a new career, a new mindset, or new relationships. Growth requires change, and that can be uncomfortable. But in order to align with your purpose, you need to be willing to let go of what’s no longer serving you.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Embrace the changes that come with growth. Let go of habits or situations that keep you stuck and make room for things that move you closer to your purpose.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Identify one area of your life where you feel resistance to change. What’s holding you back? Write down the steps you need to take to move forward and take that first step today.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 5: Practice Self-Compassion -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400 mb-4">Step 5: Practice Self-Compassion—Be Gentle with Yourself</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Finding your purpose is a journey, and that journey isn’t always smooth. It’s easy to get discouraged when things don’t go as planned, but self-compassion is key. Instead of being hard on yourself, treat yourself with kindness and understanding.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">The path to purpose is about progress, not perfection. Be gentle with yourself as you make changes and move forward.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">The next time you catch yourself being self-critical, pause and ask yourself, “What would I say to a friend in this situation?” Offer yourself the same compassion and understanding you’d give someone you care about.</p>

    <!-- Step 6: Take Action Towards Your Purpose -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400 mb-4">Step 6: Take Action Towards Your Purpose—Start Today</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Understanding your purpose is one thing, but taking action is what brings it to life. It’s easy to get caught up in overthinking, but the key to alignment is consistent action, even if it’s small steps at first.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Don’t wait for everything to be perfect—start today. Whether it’s setting a new goal, taking up a new hobby, or making a new connection, every step you take towards your purpose is a step towards a more fulfilling life.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Choose one action you can take today that aligns with your purpose. It doesn’t have to be huge—just make sure it’s in the direction of what matters most to you.</p>
