    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Let’s face it—finding the balance between work and life can feel like chasing a unicorn. Between deadlines, meetings, and the endless to-do list, it often feels like there’s never enough time for yourself, let alone family, friends, or hobbies.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">But here’s the truth: work-life balance isn’t about perfect equilibrium. It’s about managing your priorities and making intentional choices that allow you to enjoy both your career and your personal life. In this post, we’ll explore 7 practical tips that will help you achieve harmony and avoid burnout.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 1: Set Clear Boundaries -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 1: Set Clear Boundaries—Protect Your Time</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">One of the biggest challenges of work-life balance is the lack of clear boundaries. Work can spill into your personal life and vice versa if you're not careful. The key is setting and respecting boundaries.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Decide on specific times when you’re “off the clock,” and communicate those boundaries to your colleagues and family. This might mean setting aside your phone after work hours or turning off email notifications on weekends.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Set a daily “shutdown” time where you stop work completely. Use this time to decompress, unwind, and enjoy your personal space.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 2: Prioritize Your Tasks -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 2: Prioritize Your Tasks—Focus on What Matters Most</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Not all tasks are created equal. To maintain balance, it’s important to prioritize what truly matters both at work and in your personal life.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Start each day by identifying the most important tasks that need your attention. This helps you focus on what moves you forward, whether it’s a career goal or personal project, while avoiding the stress of feeling pulled in every direction.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Use the “Eisenhower Matrix” to categorize tasks into urgent/important, not urgent/important, urgent/not important, and not urgent/not important. Focus on what matters most, and let go of the rest.</p>

    <!-- Step 3: Make Time for Yourself -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 3: Make Time for Yourself—Self-Care is Essential</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Taking care of yourself is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. To perform well at work and nurture your relationships, you need to prioritize your own well-being.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Whether it’s reading a book, going for a walk, or simply sitting in silence, carve out time in your day that’s just for you. These moments of self-care recharge your energy and help you stay focused throughout the day.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Schedule 15-30 minutes of “me time” each day. Treat it like an important meeting, and make sure nothing interferes with this time.</p>

    <!-- Step 4: Learn to Say No -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 4: Learn to Say No—Don’t Overcommit Yourself</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Saying yes to everything is a surefire way to feel overwhelmed and spread yourself too thin. To maintain balance, you need to say no sometimes—even to good opportunities.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Be mindful of your time and energy. If a commitment doesn’t align with your priorities or fit within your schedule, it’s okay to politely decline.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Practice saying no with kindness. You don’t have to give a lengthy explanation—just politely decline and move on.</p>

    <!-- Step 5: Delegate Responsibilities -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 5: Delegate Responsibilities—You Don’t Have to Do It All</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Delegation isn’t just for the workplace—it’s essential in every area of your life. Whether it’s sharing household chores or delegating tasks at work, you don’t have to carry the burden alone.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When you delegate, you free up time for more important tasks and reduce your stress. Be open to asking for help, and don’t hesitate to hand over tasks that others can handle.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">At work, identify tasks that can be handled by others and delegate them. At home, divide responsibilities with your family to create a more balanced environment.</p>

    <!-- Step 6: Stay Organized -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 6: Stay Organized—Avoid the Chaos</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">A cluttered workspace or home can add to your stress and make balancing life even more challenging. Staying organized helps you stay on top of tasks, reduces decision fatigue, and creates a peaceful environment.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Keep your workspace clean, create a filing system, and use digital tools like calendars and task managers to stay organized.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Spend 10 minutes at the end of each day organizing your space and planning for the next day. This will help you feel more in control and reduce stress.</p>

    <!-- Step 7: Be Present—Enjoy the Moment -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 mb-4">Step 7: Be Present—Enjoy the Moment</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">In our busy lives, it’s easy to multitask and rush through activities. However, being present in the moment is key to achieving work-life balance.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When you’re at work, focus on work. When you’re with family or friends, give them your full attention. Being present helps you enjoy the time you have and creates stronger connections with others.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Put away distractions like your phone when you’re spending time with loved ones. Make a conscious effort to be fully present in every moment.</p>
