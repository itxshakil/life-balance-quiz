    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="mb-8">

    </section>

    <!-- Step 1: Breathe Deeply—The Power of Controlled Breathing -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 1: Breathe Deeply—The Power of Controlled Breathing</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When stress hits, the first thing that happens is your breathing becomes shallow and rapid. But did you know that taking a few deep breaths can help calm your nervous system and bring your body back to a relaxed state?</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Controlled breathing can be a simple yet powerful tool to manage stress. It’s a quick and effective way to center yourself and regain control over your emotions.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Next time you feel stressed, take 5 deep breaths. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, and then exhale for 4 seconds. Repeat until you feel calmer. It’s a small habit that can make a big difference.</p>

    <!-- Step 2: Prioritize Your Tasks—Tackle One Thing at a Time -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 2: Prioritize Your Tasks—Tackle One Thing at a Time</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you’re juggling multiple tasks. But multitasking can actually increase stress levels and decrease your productivity. The key to managing stress is focusing on one task at a time.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Start by prioritizing your tasks and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps. When you tackle one thing at a time, you’ll feel more in control and less stressed.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Make a to-do list and focus on your top 3 priorities for the day. Once you’ve completed each task, cross it off the list—it’s a simple way to stay organized and reduce stress.</p>

    <!-- Step 3: Move Your Body—Physical Activity to Release Tension -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 3: Move Your Body—Physical Activity to Release Tension</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Exercise isn’t just for physical health—it’s also a powerful tool for managing stress. Physical activity helps release endorphins, the body’s natural mood boosters, and relieves built-up tension.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When you move your body, you shift your focus away from stress and improve your mental clarity.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Take a 20-minute walk, stretch, or do a quick workout in the morning or during a break. It doesn’t have to be a long session—just enough to get your body moving and reset your mind.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Step 4: Stay Connected—Social Support Reduces Stress -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 4: Stay Connected—Social Support Reduces Stress</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When you’re feeling stressed, it’s tempting to isolate yourself. But social support is one of the most effective ways to manage stress. Talking to a friend, family member, or colleague can help you gain perspective and feel supported.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Building a support network gives you a sense of belonging, which can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Reach out to someone you trust and share how you’re feeling. Sometimes, just having a conversation is enough to help you feel lighter and more supported.</p>

    <!-- Step 5: Practice Mindfulness—Stay Present, Not Overwhelmed -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 5: Practice Mindfulness—Stay Present, Not Overwhelmed</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the moment. By focusing on the here and now, you can break free from overwhelming thoughts about the past or future that often cause stress.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Practicing mindfulness can help you reduce anxiety, improve concentration, and foster a sense of calm.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Set aside 5 minutes each day to practice mindfulness. You can meditate, focus on your breathing, or simply pay attention to the sights and sounds around you. It’s a great way to reset your mind and reduce stress.</p>

    <!-- Step 6: Get Enough Sleep—Rest to Recharge -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 6: Get Enough Sleep—Rest to Recharge</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Lack of sleep can make everything feel harder, and stress can worsen without proper rest. Sleep is crucial for your body’s recovery and mental clarity, and it helps you manage stress more effectively.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Prioritize sleep by establishing a bedtime routine and creating a sleep-friendly environment. When you’re well-rested, you’ll be better equipped to handle stress.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Create a calming bedtime routine that includes activities like reading, journaling, or practicing relaxation techniques.</p>

    <!-- Step 7: Say No—Avoid Overcommitting -->
    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-500 dark:text-green-400 mb-4">Step 7: Say No—Avoid Overcommitting</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">It’s easy to say yes to everything when you want to please others, but overcommitting can quickly lead to burnout. Learning to say no is an essential part of managing stress and setting healthy boundaries.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">When you say no to tasks that don’t align with your priorities or values, you make room for things that truly matter.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Next time you’re asked to take on a new responsibility, pause and ask yourself if it aligns with your current priorities. If not, it’s okay to say no.</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">There’s no shame in asking for help—it’s a courageous step toward healing and growth.</p>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Actionable Tip:</p>
